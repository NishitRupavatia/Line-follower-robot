# Line Follower Robot with Obstacle Avoidance and Bluetooth Control

## Overview

This project showcases a multi-functional **line follower robot** developed as part of the *IC 152: Makerspace Laboratory* course. The robot is designed to autonomously navigate a path using infrared sensors, detect and avoid obstacles using an ultrasonic sensor, and receive commands via a mobile app using Bluetooth communication.

## System Design

### Line Following

IR sensors detect the black line and guide the robotâ€™s direction by controlling the speed of the motors. Left/right turns are handled by varying motor speeds on each side.

### Obstacle Avoidance

The HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor measures distance in front of the robot. If an object is detected within 15 cm, the robot halts and reroutes to avoid it, then resumes line-following.

### Bluetooth Control

A mobile phone app connects via the HC-05 Bluetooth module to allow remote operation, enabling control over direction and speed with predefined commands.

## How to Use

1. Power the robot using lithium-ion batteries.  
2. Upload the Arduino sketch to the board using the Arduino IDE.  
3. Place the robot on a surface with a black line.  
4. The robot will follow the line autonomously.  
5. Introduce obstacles to observe avoidance behavior.  
6. Connect a mobile phone via Bluetooth for manual control if needed.
